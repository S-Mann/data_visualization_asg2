# Movie Analysis

This is my data visualization assignment, I have used the [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata) to visualize profits made from movies and different actors using d3, plotly, stack.gl, different bootstrap and jQuery components. I was really impressed to see how much of a performance bump stack.gl provides over other libraries, plotly js is a thing of beauty when used right.

Just download the zip and run the index.html
